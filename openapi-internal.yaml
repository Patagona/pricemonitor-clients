        This operation is used to import products into the pricemonitor.
        This process is represented by a task, which is processed asynchronously.
        In the response you will receive a url which is used to check the status of the import process. <br>

        When the process is done all products in csv file from the request body will be in the pricemonitor.
        Products that were already present before have been updated and new products have been added. <br>

        Warning: All products that were in the pricemonitor before but are not present in the new import will be deleted.

        Identification of the products is done based on the identifying attributes (see parameter: patagona-product-identifying-attributes)

        This operation is used to import products into the pricemonitor.
        This process is represented by a task, which is processed asynchronously.
        In the response you will receive a url which is used to check the status of the import process. <br>

        When the process is done all products in csv file from the request body will be in the pricemonitor.
        Products that were already present before have been updated and new products have been added. <br>

        Warning: All products that were in the pricemonitor before but are not present in the new import will be deleted.
