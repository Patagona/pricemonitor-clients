      Overview, explanation and pointers to the API documentation.


      ## Introduction


      The Omnia 2.0 API (also known as the Pricemonitor API) gives access to the
      superpowers behind the Omnia Retail platform.


      The [Omnia 2.0 app](https://app.omniaretail.com/) and the [Pricemonitor
      app](https://pricemonitor.patagona.de/) are the main consumers of this
      API, but we also have endpoints available to customers to integrate the
      API directly with their own systems.


      ## Common use cases for Omnia 2.0


      These are common API operations for customers to integrate Omnia with
      their own systems:

      - Retrieve market data

      - Retrieve price recommendations

      - Manage your product assortment

      - Provide offers for custom sources


      ### Retrieve market data via API


      Use [this operation](#operation/getOffersVendorV3) to retrieve the newest
      offers in the market for products for a given time range. It supports
      returning paged results. We recommend to retrieve with a page size of at
      most 1,000 products.


      ### Retrieve price recommendations via API


      Use [this operation](#operation/getPriceRecommendation) to retrieve the
      price recommendations for all products for a specified timerange. It
      supports returning paged results.


      ### Query products via API


      Use [this operation](#operation/queryProductsVendorV3) to retrieve
      products via a query. It supports returning paged results. We recommend to
      retrieve with a page size of 10,000 products.


      ### Manage your product assortment


      Use [this operation](#operation/postProductsImportVendorV3) to upload your
      product assortment in JSON format. We recommend that you provide your
      product data in multiple parts via sequential requests to this endpoint.
      After providing all data, you need to delete the old data via [this
      operation](#operation/deleteProducts) by specifying a timestamp just
      before your import.


      If you cannot use the JSON format, as a fallback, we support uploading
      your product assortment to our system in CSV format via [this
      operation](#operation/putProductsImportVendorV3).


      ### Provide offers for custom sources


      Use [this operation](#operation/postOffersInABulkVendorV2) to provide
      external offers for your products to our system.


      ## Pagination


      API endpoints can potentially return a lot of items. Returning all data as
      one response to one request can overload the server, the database or the
      client. Returning all items may even be unnecessary when the client is
      only interested in the top N entries. So API operations that could return
      a lot of data support pagination. The pagination approach used in the
      latest version of API operations is described here.


      ### Pagination basics


      Operations that support pagination:

      - Return a subset of all matching items based on parameters in the
      request. Such a subset is called a page.
        - The `limit` parameter defines the maximum number of items returned per page.
        - The `start` parameter defines which page is returned.
      - Return the requested page as an array within a `data` object within the
      response.

      - Can return all matching items by subsequently requesting multiple pages.


      There are no subsequent matching items if the number of items in a
      response is smaller than the requested `limit`.


      ### `limit` parameter


      This parameter defines how many items are returned at most in a singe
      response. This is also called the page size.


      The API documentation states the range that is allowed to be specified by
      the client.


      ### `start` parameter


      This parameter defines from which item in the total result set this
      request wants data to be returned. It basically defines what page should
      be returned. The index of the first item is 0. If the value of `start` is
      beyond the number of matching items, an empty `data` array is returned in
      the response.


      Pagination itself only works when the entries have a stable sorting. This
      is the responsibility of the API.


      ### Example of paginated requests


      To request items with a page size of 1000, these are the pagination
      parameter values to be used for subsequent requests


      | request # | start | limit |

      | --------- | ----- | ----- |

      | 1st       | 0     | 1000  |

      | 2nd       | 1000  | 1000  |

      | 3rd       | 2000  | 1000  |

      | ...                       |


      So the values for each subsequent request can be calculated by `start =
      previous start + limit`. All the other parameters of the API request must
      keep the same value to get stable sorting for a stable total result set.


      A response looks like this:



      ``` json

      {
         "data": [
            <item 1>,
            <item 2>,
            ...
         ]
      }

      ```


      The client must compare the number of items in the `data` array with the
      used `limit` parameter. If they are equal there is likely a next page. If
      the number of items returned is less than the page size, there is no next
      page.


      > Note: In rare cases there is no next page even though the response has
      no less than a page size of items. E.g. when there are 2000 total items
      and using a page size of 1000. Here the client will make a request with
      `start=1000` and `limit=1000`. The response for this 2nd page request will
      have 1000 items. Then the client can't know in advance if there are
      further pages and it has to make an additional request. This third page
      request will return an empty array.


      ## Authentication


      There are two authentication methods supported:

      - For API integration with other systems basic authentication is used.

      - The Omnia 2.0 application uses JWT bearer tokens.

      # Import products


      We have two options: Either you provide the products as
      [JSON](#operation/postProductsImportVendorV3) or as
      [CSV](#operation/putProductsImportVendorV3). The product import via
      [JSON](#operation/postProductsImportVendorV3) is recommended.


      Notes:

      - When importing products, you need to provide an unique product
      identifier. We only allow importing products when they can be uniquely
      identified. In the very past we solely relied on GTIN for that, but not
      all customers have a GTIN. So we introduced the generic concept of the
      unique product identifier.

      - When importing products, you can additionally provide _tags_. These tags
      are key/value pairs (custom fields) which can be used to categorize your
      products: E.g. you could add the brand of the product.<br />The tag names
      need to be unique and non-empty.

      - In some endpoints we use caching for up to 5 minutes. So your newly
      imported products might need up to 5 minutes to get visible.

      - Timing is important: It's recommended to import products during a period
      when no monitorings are scheduled. Otherwise, the monitoring does not
      cover the most recently added products. A subsequent monitoring run will
      cover the previously added products.


      ## Recommended tags


      To get the most value out of the Omnia 2.0 insights dashboards, we
      recommend to include the following tag-keys in your imports. These product
      attributes can be used to drill-down into market and pricing insights.


      | Key | Description of value |

      | ---- | ------------------- |

      | brand | Values should include the brand of the respective product |

      | sku | If available, you can also include the stock keeping unit
      identifier |

      | amountInStock |  If available, you can also include the current stock
      level of each product |

      | topCategory  | Your product categories, highest level |

      | midCategory  | Your product categories, mid level |

      | lowCategory  |  Your product categories, lowest level |

      | purchasePrice | The purchase price of your product |

      | imageUrl | A url containing an image of your product |

      | logisticalCost | The logistical cost of your product |

      | recommendSellingPrice | The manufacturer suggested retail price or
      recommended retail price of your product |

      | vat | The Value Added Tax (VAT) for your product |


      Notes:

      - These fields are not mandatory for a successful import. They are
      optional, but recommended, to get the most value out of the insights in
      the UI of Omnia 2.0. If you intend to use them in the recommended way

      - The keys for the tags are case sensitive, so specify exactly as above.


      ## Import products via JSON (recommended)


      The preferred way to import products via API is via
      [JSON](#operation/postProductsImportVendorV3).


      This operation adds products to our system using _upsert_ (insert or
      update). It needs to be used in conjunction with a timestamp-based
      [product deletion operation](#operation/deleteProducts).


      The delete makes sure that old products, which are not part of your
      assortment anymore, are dropped from the system.


      Typical usage pattern:

      1. Remember the current time in UTC

      2. [Add products in chunks](#operation/postProductsImportVendorV3).
      Recommended chunk size: 1,000 products

      3. [Delete old products](#operation/deleteProducts) that are not needed in
      the system anymore by the timestamp from step 1 minus some extra buffer,
      e.g. one minute.


      ## Import products via CSV (not recommended)


      In order to provide products to our system you can send a CSV file via
      [this operation](#operation/putProductsImportVendorV3). This endpoint
      deactivates all current products and activates the ones which are provided
      via CSV.


      This creates a "task" at our side. Tasks are processed asynchronously.
      Typically, a big product import with 500K products takes 5-10 minutes. The
      mentioned endpoint returns a task id and a url where you can check the
      task state. Possible task states are: pending, executing, failed and
      succeeded. The last two states are representing a completed task. The task
      itself contains more details about how many products could get imported,
      which ones failed plus a preview failure list.


      When the product import successfully completed then the previously
      imported products have been deleted and only the ones which you have
      provided via CSV file are active in our system.


      # Query products


      Use [this operation](#operation/queryProductsVendorV3) to retrieve
      products via a query you specify in the request. It supports returning
      paged results. We recommend to retrieve with a page size of up to 10,000
      products.


      # Get all products


      Use [the query operation](#operation/queryProductsVendorV3) and just omit
      the query filter in the request. Results are paginated. A page size of at
      most 10,000 is recommended.


      # Determine internal product ids from your product ids


      Our system uses internal product ids that are distinct from your products
      ids. These internal product ids are sometimes referred to as
      _pricemonitor_ product ids.


      Often API operations require internal product ids to be specified. So you
      may need to map your product id onto our internal product id.


      There are two options:

      - Either you store the internal product ids after [importing
      products](#operation/postProductsImportVendorV3) into our system. The
      import operation returns the internal product ids for each imported
      product.

      - Or you map product ids on the fly when you need to by
      [querying](#operation/queryProductsVendorV3) specifying your product ids
      in the query. It's recommended to specify 1,000 product ids at once.

      > Within the price recommendations we are providing a field called
      `relevantDomain`. This field contains from which domain the price
      recommendation originates.


      # Retrieve price recommendations


      ## Getting all price recommendations


      You can get all price recommendations via [this
      operation](#operation/getPriceRecommendation).


      It's a paginated endpoint, so you have to request multiple pages. See
      [pagination](#section/Pagination). Recommended page size is 1000.


      It's important that you define a timerange (by providing `startTime` and
      `endTime` parameters) in order to guarantee a stable pagination. This
      endpoint returns the most recent price recommendations per product and
      domain: This means that price recommendations from older price calculation
      runs within the provided timerange are ignored.

      # What tasks are


      Task are are asynchronously handled jobs in our system, like price
      calculation or monitoring jobs.


      You can use [this operation to find tasks for a
      contract](#operation/getTasksVendorV2).


      # Price calculation tasks


      A use case for the find tasks operation is to get the most recent
      completed price calculation task to see if it was successful or failed.
      And if it failed, what the failures were.


      ### Finding most recent price calculation tasks


      If you want to find the most recent completed price calculation task you
      need the following query parameters:


      ```

      limit=1

      includeFailures=true

      taskTypeFilter=backend.tasks.pricemonitor.offers.preprocessing

      taskState=succeeded,failed    // this only returns completed tasks.
      Currently running tasks are ignored

      ```


      Optional: You might want to adjust the queried timerange and specify
      `minCreationDate` and `maxCreationDate`. By default all tasks ever are
      queried.



      It can happen that there no price calculation has been run yet, then an
      empty list of tasks is returned.


      Apart from that these are the possible task states:


      | Task state | Description |

      | ---------- | ----------- |

      | succeeded | At least for one product a price calculation has been
      calculated |

      | failed | Either all price calculations for every product failed OR the
      whole price calculation process failed due to an unexpected error |


      If there are price calculation failures on a product level, you find the
      dedicated failures in the failures array of the task. Be aware: at most
      1000 failures are returned.


      If you want to have statistics for how many products a price has been
      calculated and how many price calculations failed on product level, then
      please take a look at the `result.operations.<successful/failed/total>`
      fields in the response.


      When a task completely fails then the response also provides a
      `failureCode` that is of interest.

      The Scheduler API operations allow for creating, updating, deleting and
      listing jobs for a contract.


      One can create jobs which get executed on a given schedule. The possible
      types for a job are fixed and defined in the `patagona-scheduler-core`.
      See the [README](https://github.com/patagona/scheduler) for more
      information.


      **Note:**  Scheduling job types unknown to the scheduler will result in
      errors.


      **Note:** For more information on the Dkron types, see the [API
      documentation of Dkron](https://dkron.io/api/).

          1. Filtering for offers of a certain product<br> This can be done by a
          ComparisonFilter with
            * the `left` side being a `StringValueProvider` with the `attributeName` value "productId"
            * the `right` side being a `StringConstantValueProvider` with the `value` being the actual pricemonitor product ID to filter offers for
            * the `comparison` being a `StringEquality`

          2. Filtering for valid offers of a certain product<br> This can be
          done by an AndFilter with
            * a) A product filter (see first supported filter)
            * b) A NotFilter which contains a ComparisonFilter
              * the `left` side being a `NumberValueProvider` with the `attributeName` value "ignoredBy"
              * the `right` side being a `NumberConstantValueProvider` with the `value` being the numeric contract id to filter offers for
              * the `comparison` being a `NumberEquality`

          3. Filtering for offers of a certain vendor<br> This can be done by a
          ComparisonFilter with
            * the `left` side being a `StringValueProvider` with the `attributeName` value "reseller_name"
            * the `right` side being a `StringConstantValueProvider` with the `value` being the actual vendor name to filter offers for
            * the `comparison` being a `StringEquality`

          Note: This endpoint will only return the newest offers for each
          product for a given time range.

            ## How to use this endpoint's result to get Total Market statistics

            ### Minimum Price

            To calculate the minimum price in the total market, you have to take
            the minimum of the `minPrice` of each domain. In the example below,
            both products have the same min prices: `min(16.00,7.99) = 7.99`.

            ### Average Price

            To calculate the average price in the total market, you have to
            calculate a **weighted average**, weighing the average price of each
            domain by its offer count. In the example below we get different
            results for the average price in the total market for product id
            `1001` and `1002` even though they have the same average price in
            each domain. This is due to the different offer counts:

              - product id `1001`: `(20.00 * 4 + 10.00 * 12) / (4 + 12) = 12.50`
              - product id `1002`: `(20.00 * 12 + 10.00 * 4) / (12 + 4) = 17.50`

            ### Offer Count

            The offer count of one product in the total market is the sum of the
            offer counts for all its domains. In the example below, both
            products would have an offer count of `12 + 4 = 16`.

            ### Market Position

            The market position of a product generally **can not be deduced**
            from the data provided in this endpoint.

        Warning: This endpoint contains complex filter structure and will be
        replaced in the future. Currently, we only allow filtering by a list of
        internal pricemonitor product ids. Please note that offer statistics can
        only be computed for at **maximum 2500** products at a time.


        To use the example request body from below, you have to adjust the
        `ownShopNames`, the `range` and `filter.right.value`. Where
        `filter.right.value` has to be a list of internal pricemonitor product
        ids corresponding to the `contractId` provided as part of the URL.


        All prices will be with or without delivery costs depending on the
        `includeDeliveryCosts` parameter in the body.

          The request body may include an optional products query. If omitted,
          all products are queried. Currently, product queries can be performed
          on two attributes:
            - "customerProductId"
            - "productId" (Patagona's internal product id; must be a numerical integer)

          Pagination is supported with a maximum limit of 10,000. For optimized
          performance:
            - Use a limit of 10,000 products per page when querying all products of a contract.
            - Prefer using "customerProductId" for queries when a product query is utilized.

          Pagination operates based on the provided products query.

          For chunked requests over a set of ids, it's straightforward to
          specify up to 10,000 customerProductId's in the query with pagination
          set at start: 0, limit: 10,000.


          The allowed query pattern is structured as follows:

        identifying attributes, which need to be provided via the request
        body.<br><br>Note:<br> This endpoint should be used in conjunction with:
        DELETE  /api/v3/vendor/contracts/{contractId}/products.<br><br>

        Procedure:<br> 1. Add your products in bulks with multiple requests via
        this endpoint.<br> 2. Send a DELETE request to
        /api/v3/vendor/contracts/{contractId}/products
           and set the parameter updatedMax to a date which is older or equal to your first request from step 1.

        This operation is used to import products into the system from CSV
        formatted data.

        This process is represented by a task, which is processed
        asynchronously.

        In the response you will receive a url which is used to check the status
        of the import process. <br>


        When the process is done all products in csv file from the request body
        will be in the pricemonitor.

        Products that were already present before have been updated and new
        products have been added. <br>


        Warning: All products that were in the pricemonitor before but are not
        present in the new import will be deleted.


        Identification of the products is done based on the identifying
        attributes (see parameter: patagona-product-identifying-attributes)


        Note: It is recommended to use the JSON variant to add products as it
        works synchronously and more efficient.

        It's a bulk endpoint which accepts an array of individual POST offers
        requests each based on a "snapshot" - a unique combination of product,
        domain, and timestamp for a list of offers.

        Please note the following consistency checks performed before offers are
        stored:

        1. Offers can only be stored if the corresponding products exist in the
        contract.

        2. Offers can only be stored if they are more recent than existing
        offers. This means that only newer snapshots are eligible for storage.

        3. Offers can only be stored if the currency is consistent. In other
        words, a single domain must use only one currency.

        4. Duplicated individual POST offers requests are stored only once.

        5. If different offers are provided for the same snapshots, then all
        conflicting snapshots will be rejected.

        6. An individual POST offers request may be rejected if the offer ID is
        not unique.

      description: >-
        This endpoint is used to query certain price recommendations. It
        supports a rather complex filtering structure. Most commonly it's used
        for querying by our internal product id.


        Here you can find an example request body for querying one product id
        (here `123456`):


        <details>

        <summary>Click to expand</summary>


        ``` json

        {
          "pagination": {
            "start": 0,
            "limit": 500
          },
          "range": {
            "start": "2023-01-07T12:05:01.000Z",
            "end": "2023-01-09T12:05:01.000Z"
          },
          "filter": {
            "filters": [{
              "left": {
                "attributeName": "productId",
                "type": "StringValueProvider"
              },
              "right": {
                "value": "123456",
                "type": "StringConstantValueProvider"
              },
              "comparison": {
                "type": "StringEquality"
              },
              "type": "ComparisonFilter"
            }],
            "type": "OrFilter"
          }
        }

        ```

        </details>


        If you want to query for multiple product ids, then you need to provide
        one object per product id in the filters-array.


        It's recommended to query for at most 1000 price recommendations at
        once.

          Currently, it supports only product queries for two attributes:<br>

          <ul>
            <li> by "customerProductId"</li>
            <li> by "productId" (Patagona's internal product id). Allowed values for 'productId' are numerical integer values</li>
          </ul>

          The maximum allowed limit in the pagination is 10000. <br>

          For better performance, when paginating over all products of a
          contract, we recommend to use a limit of 10000 products per page.

          Pagination works with respective to the given products query. <br>

          This is most relevant when querying for a set of customerProductId's.
          <br>

          When the requests are chunked over a set of ids, it is easiest to
          provide up to 10000 customerProductId's in the query and keep the
          pagination at start: 0, limit: 10000. <br>

          The only allowed pattern is currently: <br>

          { <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;"pagination": { <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"start": ${start}, <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"limit": ${limit} <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;}, <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;"filter": { <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"oneOf": { <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"field": "customerProductId", <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"values": [${customerProductIds as
          a list of strings}] <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>

          } <br>

          <br>

          example: <br>

          { <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;"pagination": { <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"start": 0, <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"limit": 10 <br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;}, <br>

        The request body may include an optional products query. If omitted, all
        products are queried. Currently, product queries can be performed on two
        attributes:
          - "customerProductId"
          - "productId" (Patagona's internal product id; must be a numerical integer)

        Pagination is supported with a maximum limit of 10,000. For optimized
        performance:
          - Use a limit of 10,000 products per page when querying all products of a contract.
          - Prefer using "productId" for queries when a product query is utilized.

        Pagination operates based on the provided products query. This is
        particularly useful when querying a set of customerProductId's. For
        chunked requests over a set of ids, it's straightforward to specify up
        to 10,000 customerProductId's in the query with pagination set at start:
        0, limit: 10,000.

        The allowed query pattern is structured as follows:

        ``` json {
          "pagination": {
            "start": ${start},
            "limit": ${limit}
          },
          "range": {
            "start": ${start},
            "end": ${end}
          },
          "filter": {
            "oneOf": {
              "field": "customerProductId",
              "values": [${customerProductIds as a list of strings}]
            }
          }
        } ```
