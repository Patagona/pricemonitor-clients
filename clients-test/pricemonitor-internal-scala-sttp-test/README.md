## pricemonitor-scala-sttp-client-test

This subproject tests the auto-generated scala-sttp api client. Specifically when the server responds with an error
status code. The project was created to formally handle and test the version incompatibility between the sttp version
used in pricemonitor-clients and [OpenApiGenerator](https://openapi-generator.tech/). For more context on that check
out [this](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/7181) bug ticket.
